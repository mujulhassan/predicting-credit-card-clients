# predicting-credit-card-clients
Using real credit risk data to predict not credible and credible credit card clients. 
There are 23 predictor variables labeled that predict a response variable Y which represents a credit card default payment where Yes = 1, and No = 0. I will be using two datasets, where I will first be building models and testing on the training dataset, in which I will select the best predictive model and evaluate it on my test set.
